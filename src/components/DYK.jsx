    "The name \"Wi-Fi\" doesn't actually stand for anything! It is a common myth that it stands for \"Wireless Fidelity.\" In reality, the Wi-Fi Alliance hired a marketing firm to create a catchy, consumer-friendly name because the technical name, \"IEEE 802.11 b Direct Sequence,\" was far too boring for the public.", 
    "The core mathematical technology that makes Wi-Fi possible was co-invented by Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr during World War II! She developed a \"frequency-hopping\" system to prevent enemy forces from jamming radio-controlled torpedoes. That exact concept of hopping across radio frequencies laid the structural groundwork for the original 1997 802.11 standard.",
    "Wi-Fi 4 brought us MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output), which uses multiple antennas to bounce signals off walls and furniture. Before Wi-Fi 4, indoor obstacles like concrete walls completely ruined your signal. With Wi-Fi 4, those reflections were actually turned into extra pathways to deliver data faster, using your home's layout to its advantage!",
    "Wi-Fi 5 introduced \"Beamforming,\" which acted like a mental upgrade for routers. Older routers broadcasted Wi-Fi signals in a massive, inefficient circle. Wi-Fi 5 routers learned to detect exactly where your phone or laptop was and focus the radio waves into a targeted beam directly at your device, similar to a spotlight.",
    "Wi-Fi 6 borrowed a clever trick from delivery trucks called OFDMA (which stands for Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access). In older generations, if three devices needed data, the router had to send three completely separate transmissions. OFDMA allows the router to split a single wireless channel into smaller sub-channels. This lets it pack data for multiple devices into a single transmission.",
    "Wi-Fi 7's Multi-Link Operation (MLO) completely destroys the old \"one lane at a time\" rule. On older routers, even if you had a dual-band router, your phone could only talk on 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz at any given split second. Wi-Fi 7 functions like downloading a massive file using two or three distinct highways at the exact same time, radically shortening wait time."
